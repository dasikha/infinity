--- | ----------- | -----------
/users/planets | GET | Retrieve all planets
/users/planets/:id | GET | Retrieve all planets by id
/users/message | GET | Retrieve all messages submitted
/users/message | POST | Submit message into the database
/users/quiz | GET | Retrieve all quiz
/users/quiz | POST | Submit answers of the quiz
/users/user | GET | Retrieve all users

### Dependencies

- Run `npm install` in project directory. This will install server-related dependencies such as express.
- `cd client` and run `yarn install`. This will install client dependencies React App.
- You can test your client app on `http://localhost:3000`
- You can test your API in `http://localhost:5000/`

### Database Prep

- Access the MySQL interface in your terminal by running `mysql -u root -p`
- Create a new database called `infinity`: create database `infinity`;
- Add a `.env` file to the main folder of this repository containing the MySQL authentication information for MySQL user. For example:

  ```bash
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USER=root
  DB_NAME=infinity
  DB_PASS=YOURPASSWORD
  ```

  - Replace `YOURPASSWORD` with your actual password

Run `npm run migrate` in the main folder of this repository, in a new terminal window. This will create tables of the infinity database with some dummy data.
