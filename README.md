### Database Prep

- Access the MySQL interface in your terminal by running `mysql -u root -p`
- Create a new database called `infinity`: create database `infinity`;
- Add a `.env` file to the main folder of this repository containing the MySQL authentication information for MySQL user. For example:

  ```bash
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USER=root
  DB_NAME=infinity
  DB_PASS=YOURPASSWORD
